# GradPath

A program that automatically generates and visualizes university graduation plans using a unique graph structure.

## How it works

Data is retrieved or downloaded from university servers. Then, the data is processed and converted into custom Python objects.
These Python objects are then ingested by a program that generates a graph structure using networkx and visualizes it using matplotlib.
