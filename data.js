We will think about how the aesthetics and significations of taste are bound up in the ways Asian Americans perceive themselves and are perceived by others, inquiring how ideas of the \"perpetual foreigner\" and the \"model minority\" might inform consumption practices. As the title of this course suggests, foodways will be a central area of analysis, never static but defined by mobility and transmission for Asian American communities. You will also be invited to explore your own relationships to Asian American food cultures through personal and academic accounts, a diverse range of media (TV, film, social media), cookbooks, and memoirs."

This advanced course, then, will introduce students to the study and practice of Asian American cyktyre as multiple , hybrid, and heterogeneous. It will do so through three sections: section one will introduce students to classical, cultural, and media concepts as well as relevant keywords outlined by Asian American Studies scholars; section two will review the work of Asian American cultural theorists; section three will focus on analyses of particular Asian American cultural productions. In doing so, students will gain an understanding of the shifting and interlocking tensions among the local, the national, and the global that form the cultural geographies of Asian America."

Quantum computers, on the  other hand, encode information in quantum objects, which exhibit probabilistic behavior when measured; thus, one might infer that this approach is more powerful in solving problems in the probabilistic realm. While instrumentation of quantum computers is in its infancy, quantum algorithms are being developed to provide efficient solutions to various probabilistic problems. This course offers a hands-on approach to quantum computing, including implementation and testing of quantum algorithms on real quantum hardware. Example codes and homework assignments will employ python modules to handle the data exchange with quantum computers.

In particular, we will be focusing on how the hero and villain maintain or disrupt specific cultural ideologies concerning race/ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and ability. This course will examine how these various ideologies have evolved throughout the 20th and 21st century, impacting the ways in which heroes and villains are both represented in American film and perceived by diverse audiences. Finally, we will examine our own complicated and sometimes troubling identification with these heroes, even when they might stand in stark contrast to our cultural values and identities."

By analyzing a variety of narrative, documentary, major studio, and independent films, we will seek to understand how American films' representations of rural, urban, and suburban spaces both reflect, contradict, and often influence our lived experiences of these spaces; in other words, this course will examine how the \"reel\" intersects with the \"real\"."

While machine learning has been around for decades, recent advances in deep neural networks have contributed to the rapid growth of applications across many disciplines, including the physical sciences. However, many of the traditional benchmark datasets for the development of neural networks are not from the physical sciences, making the use of off-the-shelf machine learning methods not always feasible or practical for the physical sciences. In this course, we will learn the fundamentals of neural networks, from the basics of a neuron to more advanced architectures, and how these tools can be applied to the physical sciences. Important considerations for data preprocessing specific to the physical sciences will be discussed, along with how to evaluate the skill, uncertainty, and confidence of neural networks with specific relevance to the physical sciences."

How common is life in the Universe? These are difficult questions, but armed with the right information, you can answer all of them. The Science and Fiction of Planetary Systems will help you develop a deeper understanding of why planets are the way they are. Along the way, you'll see examples of mistakes made in classic science fiction movies, novels and short stories and get the chance to invent your own plausible planets!"

The course culminates not in the deliverable to the client but the student's reflections and synthesis of learning. The course offers the opportunity for students to think critically about problem-solving and have a defining learning experience to reflect upon in their future careers."

An article in the New York Times, in 2018, declared an \"Insect Apocalypse\" that for the first time brought the unexplained declines in insects to the public and suggested a catastrophe awaits our planet. Scientists have documented the loss of insect species at a rate exceeding the extinction rates associated with the major geological events in Earth's history. Based on science and research, students will be provided with background, and discover on their own, the diversity of the form and functions of insects, as well as how they evolved and persisted for 400 million years. The course, designed for students of any major, celebrates the incredible variation of insect life and what they do to support life on our planet. The course will highlight the use of scientific research to understand and respond to the global crisis."

The number and complexity of financial reporting standards that require or allow assets and liabilities to be reported at fair value has increased substantially in recent years. The technical accounting standards that include fair value are complex in and of themselves, and the valuation measurements add substantially to the complexity. Further complexity is added to the dynamic because the audit firm is prohibited by the AICPA's independence rules from performing the valuation or providing significant assistance in technical accounting or the fair value measurement. Independent valuation/appraisal specialists are frequently preferred or required by the reporting company and/or the audit firm.

This course is designed to promote independent learning. Faculty members will offer mini-modules on key themes such as team dynamics, client relations and consulting protocols but their primary role will be to facilitate the ALP process and serve as consultants to the student teams.Selecting the right project and defining it unambiguously sets the stage for the rest of the ALP process improvement or problem solving effort, ultimately leading to a relevant, value added and well-received deliverable. Poor problem selection creates longer-term problems for both ALP teams and the sponsoring organization and can reduce or impede the quality of your learning experience. For this reason, we will lay the foundation for the final selection of projects during this term (a) soliciting ideas from all students, and (b) offering feedback to identify and nurture the most promising ideas."

Entrepreneurship is about pursuing hunches about solutions to customer problems and thereby creating value. Testing these hunches requires getting customers to evaluate solutions. It is difficult to attract resources (either human or financial) before it is known if the hunch is correct, but testing hunches requires resources. This course provides iterative tools to solve this chicken and egg problem. We will also focus on specific skill building exercises, such as pitching and networking."

In particular, we will be focusing on how the hero and villain maintain or disrupt specific cultural ideologies concerning race/ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and ability. This course will examine how these various ideologies have evolved throughout the 20th and 21st century, impacting the ways in which heroes and villains are both represented in American film and perceived by diverse audiences. Finally, we will examine our own complicated and sometimes troubling identification with these heroes, even when they might stand in stark contrast to our cultural values and identities."

Students will explore these films in their socio-historical and artistic contexts, considering the influences and innovations that have shaped them and analyzing their reception by audiences and critics. After reading about the films they view, and participating in class discussions, students will be ready to complete their analytical written assignments, for which they will critically examine the films by applying key concepts such as gender, sexuality, race, gaze, style, representation, power, diaspora, etc."

When do emotions serve the interests of those in power, and when do they resist dominant ideologies? These questions have fascinated scholars from a variety of fields, from linguistics to psychology to literary studies. This course posits that an analysis of artistic and cultural products can reveal important insights about these questions. We will thus read a variety of works of Greco-Roman literature with the above questions in mind, comparing these ancient texts to modern-day films, testing whether and how the portrayal of emotions has changed over time. Still, we will not neglect the discoveries from fields outside of literary studies: throughout the semester, we will periodically discuss relevant works of psychology, sociology, and more, interpreting the texts and films at hand through an interdisciplinary lens."

As computational processes shape ever more dimensions of everyday life from the personal to the global scale, understanding how they operate and how power operates within them grows ever more important. Combating racism and sexism is not as simple as ensuring the pool of programmers and engineers is more diverse; structures of power are embedded in digital technologies as they are in all aspects of our society, and we must learn to perceive their operation if we hope to transform them. We will examine how racism and sexism operate in the field of computer science and in everyday uses of digital technologies, while studying how feminist and racial justice movements have created alternative approaches.

These advances have enabled many people to do things they previously were incapable of but have also brought about a series of ethical questions around their development and use. These developments raise fundamental questions around whether it is even possible to develop generative AI technology that empowers rather than replaces people, and which serves human values such as rights, justice, and dignity. It also raises the question: Is generative AI different from other technologies that can be used toward both positive and negative ends?"

While we humans perceive the world by looking, listening, touching, smelling, and tasting, tradit form of machine intelligence has primarily focused on a single sensory modality, often vision. To truly understand the world around us, AI must learn to jointly interpret multimodal signals. This graduate-level seminar course explores computer vision from a multimodal perspective, focusing on learning algorithms that augment vision with other essentiamodalities, such as audio, touch, language, and more. The majority of the course will consist of student presentations, experiments, and paper discussions, and we will delve into the latest research and advancements in multimodal perception."

We often take for granted the services infrastructure bring us. As a consequence, the United States, which at one time was a world leader in creating infrastructure, is experiencing an infrastructure crisis. Furthermore, not everyone experiences this issue equally. This course is designed to identify the root causes of the crisis. You will explore emerging social, political, legal, cultural, and social justice issues associated with the building and maintenance of infrastructure from the perspective of Science and Technology Studies (STS) and engineers. You will work with a volunteer corps of professional engineers from a variety of disciplines on a service-learning project designed to assess the safety and vitality of infrastructure."

First, its objective is to understand the role of financial markets for fluctuations in the macroeconomy. More specifically, starting from a complete markets benchmark, we study canonical types of credit market frictions that give rise to macroeconomic effects. Second, the course aims to enhance the students' toolkit to carry out state-of-the-art research in macroeconomics in general. It provides plenty of practical exercise to take models (usually DSGE models with financial frictions) to the computer. Third, alongside the methodological content, we revisit empirical facts on the regularities of financial variables, the 2008-09 global financial crisis and the Covid-19 recession."

To an increasing extent, some of the biggest global challenges--ranging from nuclear proliferation, to climate change, to economic growth--require U.S.-China cooperation if they are to be managed effectively. Yet the U.S.-China relationship is at times turbulent, and its future remains highly uncertain. Will the U.S. and China be able to forge a closer partnership that will enable them to cooperate in dealing with some of the vexing challenges facing the international community?  Or are they more likely to drift toward a more adversarial relationship, as China's growing power--and the US reaction--generate a vicious cycle of mutual mistrust?  In this class, students will grapple with these questions as they learn about the history of U.S.-China relations, and about many of the current issues facing the relationship."

Most people in all societies learn and use their native language or languages with apparent ease - but don't be fooled: languages are highly complex, and speaking and understanding language requires some amazing feats of mental acrobatics. Thus there are many opportunities for difficulties with language, which is the focus of our field. Understanding difficulties with speech, language, and hearing require first understanding how processing works when language is successful - the psychological (behavioral) and neurobiological (brain) factors that enable people to learn and use language despite its intricacies, the structure and properties of language itself, and how knowledge of language is acquired, represented, and processed in the mind and brain."

It depends what language you speak\" and \"Science's English dominance hinders diversity\" invite you to think about the impact of words on thought and behavior. These are stories about how humans acquire and use language, but they ultimately address big questions about how we experience knowledge itself. In a world of unprecedented access to science journalism, did you ever read a headline about human behavior and wonder: How do we know? This class takes up the elegant ways cognitive scientists design experiments to answer crucial questions about language and thought, brain and behavior, that have no intuitive answers. Students will dive deep into the media coverage of their favorite claims about what we know, debate the psychological science behind these claims, and develop transferable critical-thinking skills in the process."

This was the first such declaration of independence ever issued, but its ideas and forms traveled far and wide. More than 100 other declarations of independence have been issued since then. The people that declaration mobilized are similarly diverse: the American Revolution is as much the story of Creek farmers, Spanish soldiers, French slaves, Canadian fugitives, Indian tea-growers, and African statesmen as it is of the Minutemen and Sons of Liberty. In this globe-trotting class, students will be positioned to debate how the familiar story of the American Revolution changes when we place it in transnational context."

With Douglass as our guide, we will examine the survival of slavery in a nation built on freedom, images of the expanding United States as a land of opportunity, and the complex meanings and tremendous costs of freedom struggles during the nineteenth century. This history will push you to think critically about the contested concepts that shape our lives, and to consider the values and the perils of a society that positions freedom as its highest ideal."

It begins with the revolutionary seeds of Soviet rule, the Russian empire and the revolution of 1905, and concludes with an examination of the former Soviet space in the aftermath of the Soviet collapse in 1991.   During the Cold War, Western pundits often referred to all Soviet citizens as \"Russians.\"  But this characterization grossly misrepresented the Soviet Union's ethnic diversity.  Even the Soviet Union's most famous leader, Josef Stalin, was not Russian.  He was Georgian.  This course seeks to dismantle the long-standing notion that \"Russian\" and \"Soviet\" are the same thing.  Instead, it emphasizes the Soviet Union as a multi-ethnic, multi-confessional society, one in which Russians interacted with myriad other ethnic groups, including Ukrainians, Kazakhs, Tatars, Armenians, Lithuanians, Tatars and others."

Through their international networks of trade, Jews learned how to negotiate with kings and to govern new, large urban communities in new lands. They took advantage of the printing press to reorganize their literary traditions of law, biblical studies and mysticism, and created new hierarchies of religious status. And they flocked to hear new kinds of enthusiast preachers, celebrating the man they saw as the messiah finally come. We will together explore the contradictory forces that ultimately gave birth to the modern Jew."

    "description": "An understanding of strategic management and marketing is provided which enables the students to lead the process of strategic planning in a healthcare organization. By conducting a marketing and strategic planning process, health care organizations are better able to cope with dramatic changes in technological, social, political, regulatory, and competitive aspects of the health care market. Strategic management enables organizations to identify issues unique to them, which hinder or promote organizational success. Through course readings, class discussions, analyses of secondary quantitative and qualitative data, and presentation of case studies, students gain a thorough understanding of the strategic management process. Students will apply core competencies through a comprehensive strategic and marketing plan. Plans will be defended through an oral presentation."

Our students have contributed more than 6,000 hours of their time and talent to campus and local organizations, and this experiential learning has provided an opportunity to apply classroom studies to the real world.  In general, these service experiences are directly relevant to their future careers as life scientists, because they contribute to improved access for all people to quality health care, to engaging STEM education, and/or to sustainable environments. The service-learning experience is introduced in the fall semester of the first year of ILS in HLSC100, and completed with a 1-credit course in the spring."

This was the first such declaration of independence ever issued, but its ideas and forms traveled far and wide. More than 100 other declarations of independence have been issued since then. The people that declaration mobilized are similarly diverse: the American Revolution is as much the story of Creek farmers, Spanish soldiers, French slaves, Canadian fugitives, Indian tea-growers, and African statesmen as it is of the Minutemen and Sons of Liberty. In this globe-trotting class, students will be positioned to debate how the familiar story of the American Revolution changes when we place it in transnational context."

This course explores how science fiction can inform future visioning by expressing and challenging ideas about nature, culture, society, and politics. We will read and watch science fiction sub-genres of future scenarios to understand how science fiction thinking is applied in environmental science, design, and planning.

The economic principle driving colonialism--capitalism--encouraged an insatiable appetite for territorial acquisition, human bondage, and destruction that stole wealth, life, and joy from racialized \"others\" to fuel European development. We maintain and further these thefts, oppressions, and exploitations through our purchasing habits and justify them through cultural ideas and ignorance. What would it mean to undo these oppressions? What must we understand to begin this process? This course surveys colonial capitalism and its legacies in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Americas, Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa to explore how history informs the present robbing of the Global South for the Global North's development, as well as pathways towards resistance and reconciliation."

    "description": "What is a fact? Science is often viewed as an unbiased, fact-based, analytical discipline. However, throughout history, science has sometimes been the most potent weapon for creating and supporting political fictions and social hierarchies. Not unlike the discipline of the humanities, the sciences practice interpretation: scientists observe behaviors, of subject or objects, and necessarily provide an interpretation of the data. But it is the recourse to the \"real\" that has made science so powerful in underwriting cultural constructs. Whether we observe how science is manipulated in the public sphere, or how it is practiced for good or ill, it has been used to naturalize hierarchies of race, class or gender. Through a range of materials--fiction, film, visual arts, scientific articles, public humanities and political theses - this course will explore one of the most potent cases of this phenomenon of \"scientific\" storytelling: the case of race."

If we hope to find 'greener' alternatives to our present courses of climate change and biodiversity loss, we must again look to the creative flights of fiction, as well as science. This course explores how science fiction can inform future visioning by expressing and challenging ideas about nature, culture, society, and politics. We will read and watch science fiction sub-genres of future scenarios to understand how science fiction thinking is applied in environmental science, design, and planning. The course challenges students to think about how 'smart', 'just', 'green' and 'resilient' visions can be integrated into sustainability transitions informed by collaborations between science and fiction."

After the \"Scientific Revolution\" in Europe, when identity was increasingly tied to biology, medical illustrations communicated theories of the ideal body and how it should, and should not, look. Doctors working in the midst of scientific revolution unequivocally tied health to race, gender, and sexuality by enlisting engravers, photographers, and printers to depict the healthy body as a European man and all others as weak, flawed, or ill. This course takes up questions about science, illustration, and identity. Can science tell us who we really are? Do pictures reveal the truth about our bodies? In this class, students will develop their own theory of how science continues to shape who we think we can be and how we might resist those limitations."

This course traces the rise of surveillance technologies used in homes, schools, workplaces, and everywhere in between to understand how we got here and where we are headed. Students will explore various framings of surveillance in Western culture, critically assess the challenges surveillance technology raises for vulnerable populations, and explore ways to stop the seemingly inevitable push toward a society without privacy."

As an increasingly multi/inter/trans/non-disciplinary intellectual community, Information Studies embraces a wide variety of conceptual frameworks, theories, methodological approaches, and intellectual traditions. As such, it is necessary to be able to bring many different intellectual perspectives to bear on the complex, nuanced, phenomena that are its focus. The variety in the intellectual toolbox of Information Studies is central to its ability to avoid reduction of its focal topics to trite, simplistic characterizations. However, the field's paradigmatic richness places particular burdens on the individual researcher. The purpose of this seminar is to help students develop a reflective practice that they can rely on to turn their interests into valuable new insights in an interdisciplinary domain like Information Studies."

They took advantage of the printing press to reorganize their literary traditions of law, biblical studies and mysticism, and created new hierarchies of religious status. And they flocked to hear new kinds of enthusiast preachers, celebrating the man they saw as the messiah finally come.

More specifically, we challenge the idea that historical physical culture practices--and the scientific processes from which they were derived--were 'neutral' or 'objective'; rather, we explore the cultural, social, political, and economic contexts shaping physical culture knowledge, study, structures, and policies across American history. The goal is for you to learn and apply techniques of historical analysis to develop a critical understanding of how knowledge about, and practices of, physical culture supported a particular social order via the construction of difference, norms, and/or hierarchies, and ultimately contributed to some of the inequalities that endure today."

    "description": "What is it about us humans and our languages that allows us to communicate in ways unmatched by other animals or powerful AI models? The question is ancient, but recent decades have seen great progress in the cognitive science of language, while expanding the diversity of languages investigated. We know much more about how languages vary, how they develop in children, how they are encoded in the mind, and relate to other domains of cognition. Major developments in statistical computation and research on animal cognition also illuminate what is (not) possible without the particular structure of the human mind. We bring this all to bear on our Big Question: What makes human language special from the viewpoint of meaning? Students will come to understand the major features of language as a vehicle for complex thought and a tool for communication. They will use this understanding in analyzing common semantic patterns and everyday conversational dynamics."

Nonetheless, all of this may seem reasonable and even justifiable within a sporting context. This course will investigate the ethical structure of sports, and what it tells us about the ethics of everyday life. Philosophy will provide the primary disciplinary context, but we will also think about sociological, legal and anthropological perspectives on sports. Issues will include the nature of sportsmanship, what types of violence in sports are acceptable, drug use in sports, what it means to be a fan (for example, asking why loyalty to your team is valuable) and how our view of sports interacts with our view of nations. By the end of the course you should have gained familiarity with a variety of ethical concepts and a sensitivity to the ethical issues in sports. You should also find that by thinking about morality in the context of sports, you will look at larger ethical issues in new ways."

Policymaking involves a myriad of public and private actors at the local, national, transnational, and global levels that have competing aims and values. Their interaction produces formal and informal policies that affect the international order, interstate relations, subnational dynamics, and individuals. Drawing on theory from multiple disciplines and case examples, the course examines governance at these interrelated levels. Students learn core concepts, debates, and actors involved in policy making, develop tools to identify the causes and consequences of different policies, and build skills to influence public governance. Students also critically analyze how the actors, institutions, and scholarship covered perpetuate systemic racism and other inequities based on gender, class, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, dis/ability, etc."

Yet, the quest for new colors has been both a result of and an excuse for colonization, appropriation of indigenous knowledge, and enslavement. When natural dyestuffs were largely replaced by synthetic dyes derived from coal tar in the late 1800s, color development posed new ecological and cultural challenges. In spite of these threats, practitioners worldwide have maintained their traditional methods without exploitation or petroleum products. This course integrates the history and chemistry of dye materials from plants and insects with hands-on practice in sustainable color creation. Students will hone the practical skills needed to source and process foraged dye materials, and apply them sustainably to fibers. Via this scientific process students will gain insight into the benefits of a naturally sourced approach to color and to life."

Are some people born happier than others? This course will teach you the scientific process that psychologists use to study happiness (and related emotional variables) and give you the opportunity to practice applying that process in a number of ways. You will learn how we (a) gather and critically evaluate research findings in the existing literature, (b) integrate those findings into coherent and testable theories, (c) design and conduct valid scientific research that tests those theories and extends our knowledge, and (d) effectively communicate our theories and findings to a wide range of audiences. The result of the process is a more accurate and objective understanding of happiness, and that is what prepares you to apply your scientific understanding to explain and influence a wide range of outcomes."

A key distinction is drawn between data that are designed, primarily survey data, and those that are found, such as administrative records, remnants of online transactions, and social media content. The course combines lectures, supplemented with assigned readings, and practical exercises. The second semester builds on the discussion of survey mode during the first semester, considering the role played by interviewers in telephone and in-person surveys and their effects on the data collected. Students next are introduced to the methods for extracting and re purposing found data for social science research. Methods for the classification of text, with an emphasis on automated coding methods, are introduced and selected applications considered (e.g., coding of open-ended survey responses, classification of the sentiments expressed in social media posts). Issues in using survey data and administrative records to measure change over time (longitudinal comparisons) are explored.

The principles of sample selection, though, can be applied to many other types of populations."

    "credits": "1",
    "description": "There is a growing demand to produce reliable estimates of various socio-economic and health characteristics at both national and sub-national levels. However, data availability at the sub-national (small area) level from a survey is often limited by cost and thus analysts must make the best possible use of all available information. The course will begin with a history of small-area estimation and different uses of small-area statistics in both public and private sectors. This course will provide an introduction to the main concepts and issues in small estimation and describes various approaches for estimating different small area parameters. Topics include standard design-based methods, various traditional indirect methods and the state-of-the-art small-area estimation methods that use both Bayesian and empirical best prediction methods. Monte Carlo simulation results and data analysis using available statistical software will be presented."

In this context, researchers must have a good understanding of data workflows and they must ensure consistent and reproducible practices in order to collaborate and consistently produce insights. This course deals with some of these essential topics. We will discuss the main types of workflows in data and survey sciences and how tools such as GitHub can enhance collaboration and insure reproducibility. We will also discuss the use of reproducible documents such as Rmarkdown or Jupyter Notebooks before covering how to work with distributed data using Spark. We will finish the course by discussing the use of dashboards and how to develop such tools using R Shiny."

    "description": "The main focus of this course lies on the introduction to statistical models and estimators beyond linear regression useful to social and economic scientists. It provides an overview of generalized linear models (GLM) that encompass non-normal response distributions to model functions of the mean. GLMs thus relate the expected mean E(Y) of the dependent variable to the predictor variables via a specific link function. This link function permits the expected mean to be non-linearly related to the predictor variables. Examples for GLMs are the logistic regression, regressions for ordinal data, or regression models for count data. GLMs are generally estimated by use of maximum likelihood estimation. The course thus not only introduces GLMs but starts with an introduction to the principle of maximum likelihood estimation."

References from the peer reviewed journals will be provided to facilitate understanding of the selected topics. Opening of this course is necessary to help graduate students to stay up-to-date with currently emerging pathogens and their evolution with changes in environment. This course is complementary to other existing microbiology courses (i.e., Viral Pathogenesis) on campus. Lectures focus on an in-depth analysis of a variety of topics in current infectious diseases. The course highlights recently published literatures to evaluate evolving trends in infectious diseases. The covered topics include subjects related with various pathogens and their adaptation strategy to enhance pathogenicity and transmissibility. The lectures will also cover the control and prevention measures of these pathogens."

As computational processes shape ever more dimensions of everyday life from the personal to the global scale, understanding how they operate and how power operates within them grows ever more important. Combating racism and sexism is not as simple as ensuring the pool of programmers and engineers is more diverse; structures of power are embedded in digital technologies as they are in all aspects of our society, and we must learn to perceive their operation if we hope to transform them. We will examine how racism and sexism operate in the field of computer science and in everyday uses of digital technologies, while studying how feminist and racial justice movements have created alternative approaches. This class is for anyone who wishes to better understand the relationships between digital technology, structural power, and social justice."

Our investigation will center on the liminal space between hegemonic culture and its prescribed excesses. These liminal spaces--between self and other, disability and enhancement, cultural hybridization, and gender crossing--shift in response to real-world sociopolitical tensions. We will consider feminist and anti-racist media scholars' concerns over representation, authorship and ideology alongside questions of technological change. Students will use analytical and creative assignments to explore not only how the scientific imaginary serves as fertile ground for feminist, disability, and anti-racist critique, but also provides a locus for alternative futures."

    "description": "In this broadly configured course, we examine the way that Black women write new narratives and possibilities for themselves in the midst of hierarchies and harms such as trans and homophobia, patriarchy, colonialism, ableism, and white supremacy. Multi-textual in content, we will examine visual art, songs, folklore, film, literature, policy and legislative reform as conduits for how Black women flip the script and imagine new possibilities for self and community. The texts we engage will reflect key moments, movements and events from the mid-twentieth century to the present day."
