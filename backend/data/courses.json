This data is a valuable resource that, when used correctly, can create a competitive edge for companies. Advances in computing hardware and algorithms have significantly improved the quality of predictions and effectiveness of business applications based on them. Expertise in working with data, and a sound knowledge of data mining/machine learning methods, is a much sought after skill. The course provides an introduction to the key tools and techniques of data mining/machine learning, including classification, prediction, cluster analysis, association rules, and text mining. The methods covered are Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-nearest neighbors, Naive Bayes, Classification and Regression Trees, Ensemble methods, Neural Networks, K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering, and Association Rules.

That inquiry will be guided by the idea of heritage, as it mobilizes the past within a broad spectrum of social, political, economic, and environmental issues. We will examine western relationships to the past as intimately tied to property and the drive to plunder, collect, and catalogue. Increasingly, conceptions of heritage include landscapes, as well as intangibles such as music, dance, and folklore. This broad definition honors the diversity of present-day relations to the past, even as it strains heritage management models that are organized around definitions and regulations, and bear the weight of historical injustice. Close examination of heritage at work within global crisis and struggle prompts questions on who owns the past, and who owns up to it.

This course moves beyond the technical applications of software and emphasizes innovative thinking, social engagement, and problem-solving. Student teams will draw upon their unique skills to create works that participants can inhabit in a way that can only be achieved using new and emerging technologies. The process starts with small-scale \"sketch\" creation and evolves into larger-scale compelling works of immersive media. Teams will need to organize research methods and goals, engage in production, and explore how to communicate, display, and document their work. As projects develop, feedback will be provided through periodic presentations, peer-critique sessions, and instructor reviews.", "grading_method": ["Regular", "Pass-Fail", "Audit"], "gen_ed": [], "core": [], "relationships": {"coreqs": null, "prereqs": "Minimum grade of C- in IMDM290.", "formerly": null, "restrictions": "Must be in the Immersive Media Design program or Permission of IMDM - Immersive Media Design program.", "additional_info": null, "also_offered_as": null, "credit_granted_for": null}, "sections": ["IMDM390-0101", "IMDM390-0201"]}, {"course_id": "IMDM399A", "semester": "202501", "name": "Independent Study", "dept_id": "IMDM", "department": "Immersive Media Design", "credits": "1", "description": "", "grading_method": ["Regular", "Pass-Fail", "Audit"], "gen_ed": [], "core": [], "relationships": {"coreqs": null, "prereqs": null, "formerly": null, "restrictions": null, "additional_info": null, "also_offered_as": null, "credit_granted_for": null}, "sections": []}, {"course_id": "IMDM491", "semester": "202501", "name": "Senior Capstone II", "dept_id": "IMDM", "department": "Immersive Media Design", "credits": "3", "description": "The second course in a two-semester senior capstone sequence.
